                <p>The text above is a mindless script of a Billie Eilish song that came up on a Tik Tok video I happened to watch before starting the exercise. It was an interview to some kids, I assume actors of "It", who were asked if they would prefer to eat a full bucket of... something I couldn't make out but sounded gross, or kiss Pennywise in the mouth. They replied at once they would kiss Pennywise in the mouth because the actor is gorgeous. </p>

                <p>He is.</p>

                <p>Very. </p>
