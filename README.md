# This is meant to be a Readme :tw-1f613: 
And I am supposed to write a long paragraph of what this is about. No idea tho. 
4 days in and, while I've been religiously keeping on schedule I don't feel I've been advancing much. So many things to do yet. 

> *Found a profile on instagram of someone who looks eerily similar to that elf who added me a year ago after the Alucard painting became viral. Thought on adding him but honestly I am tired. Of these guys, of the dynamic, of mankind in general.*
- Kiddo

And now this is a list of the stuff I am yet to buy:

- Soap for washing clothes.
- Proper green tea.
- Probably eggs.
- I will most likely run out of greens so that too.
- A socket converter?
- Sponge.
- Kitchen towels.
- I'd do good with new tenis shoes and a sundress.

We probably shouldn't be this self confessing on a doc that will be online for everyone to read :/
